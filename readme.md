#Sample Project

This project aims to use electron and reactjs to create a simple facebook messenger using facebook chat api.
It is a sample project and I may or may not continue to work on it. It is meant for investigating technologies
such as nodejs (io.js), reactjs (with flux), typescript, electron etc. If you are also investigating into
these technologies like myself, this project may help you.

I have been a .net developer for around a decade and have sound knowledge of javascript, but the new trends in
javascript like es6/7, typescript, babel are new to me and I'm trying learn by doing approach. I have been reading
a lot of blogs on these technologies lately, specially reactjs and flux. So, this project serves as a vessel to get my
hands dirty.
